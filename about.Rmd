  Using R to analyze/illustrate data and backup some of the FRM questions

Hello! I'm David Harper, CFA, FRM. I started [bionicturtle.com](http://www.bionicturtle.com) in 2004 and built it into the #1 exam preparation provider (EPP) for the Financial Risk Manager (FRM). In February of 2021, I sold the business to [CeriFi](http://cerifi.com) and continue to run it as President, Bionic Turtle, a CeriFi company. 

This is a [distill blog](https://github.com/rstudio/distill) that holds my code snippets.
