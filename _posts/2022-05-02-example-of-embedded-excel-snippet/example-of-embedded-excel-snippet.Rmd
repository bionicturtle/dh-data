This is a distill blog per my [brief introduction](https://dh-data.org/posts/2022-01-11-new-distill-site-in-15-minutes/). Each post (like this) is an RMarkdown file (.Rmd) which is ideal (designed for) for embedding code chunks in notebooks. The Rmd is knitted/rendered to HTML. I'm sure what I did here is NOT the most efficient: I inserted the iframe into the post-rendered HTML file, rather than the pre-processed RMD, then built/pushed the page.

It's easy in Excel to create such fields by concatenating with TEXT(G10,"0.0%").
