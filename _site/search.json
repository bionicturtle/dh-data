I’m David Harper, CFA, FRM. I started bionicturtle.com in\r\n            2004 and built it into the #1 exam preparation provider\r\n            (EPP) for the Financial Risk Manager (FRM). In February of\r\n            2021, I sold the business to CeriFi where I continue to run\r\n            it as President, Bionic Turtle, a CeriFi company. And now\r\n            I’m part\r\n            of a great team that is building the world’s greatest\r\n            platform for financial education at every stage of your\r\n            career.\r\n            I love learning about (and teaching) risk. I also write\r\n            investing articles at Seeking Alpha, where I disclose my\r\n            portfolio/trades and practice risk management. My focus is\r\n            disruptive technologies, patient GARP-style with a portfolio\r\n            risk overlay; e.g., diversification. The market wants growth\r\n            but I’m a value technician at heart, consequently I am\r\n            willing to wait for great companies to prove their worth to\r\n            the general audience. I have a BA, Economics from UC,\r\n            Berkeley. I earned my CFA in 2003 and my FRM in 2004.\r\n            I’ve been training and practicing data science for\r\n            several years. Of course, my preferred data tool is R (aka, #RStats,\r\n            #rstat). The best thing about R is the amazing\r\n            community, there is nothing quite like an RStudio\r\n            conference. Online I try to keep sharp with Coursera,\r\n            datacamp and perhaps the most talented data science\r\n            instructor on the planet: Matt Dancho’s Business\r\n            Science.\r\n            I am extremely interested (and invested) in digital\r\n            disruption and the future of work (FOW), including EdTech,\r\n            talent marketplaces and work management (my favorite\r\n            software is wrike).\r\n            This is a distill site\r\n            and this About page is a postcard\r\n            (by Sean Kross)\r\n          \r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n            \r\n              David Harper\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      LinkedIn\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      Twitter\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      GitHub\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      Email\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                  \r\n              \r\n            \r\n            \r\n              Hello!
