I’m David Harper, CFA, FRM. I started bionicturtle.com in\r\n            2004 and built it into the #1 exam preparation provider\r\n            (EPP) for the Financial Risk Manager (FRM). In February of\r\n            2021, I sold the business to CeriFi where I continue to run\r\n            it as President, Bionic Turtle, a CeriFi company. And now\r\n            I’m part\r\n            of a great team that is building the world’s greatest\r\n            platform for financial education at every stage of your\r\n            career.\r\n            I love teaching (and learning about) risk. I’m also write\r\n            articles at Seeking Alpha, where I disclose my\r\n            portfolio/trades and practice risk management. I have a BA,\r\n            Economics from UC, Berkeley. I earned my CFA in 2003 and my\r\n            FRM in 2004.
